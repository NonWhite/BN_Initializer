\subsection{Conclusions and Future Work}
	\begin{frame}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Experiments with real-world datasets containing from 15 to 57 variables demonstrate that compared to the commonly used strategy of generating initial ordering uniformly at random the proposed heuristics lead to better solutions on average, and increase the convergence of the search with only a small overhead
			\item Although the gains observed in our experiments are small, we expect larger differences for datasets with more variables
			\item Our proposed techniques could be adapted to generate initial solutions also for Structure- and Equivalence-based local search methods by returning directed acyclic graphs instead of node orderings
			\item Another extension of this work is to employ the proposed heuristics in branch-and-bound solvers for finding optimal solutions
