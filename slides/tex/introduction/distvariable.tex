\subsection{Probability Distribution of a Variable}
	\begin{frame}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Every assignment of value to a variable correspond to an event:
				\[ {Gender} = M \leftrightarrow \alpha = \{ ( M , s ) , ( M , b ) \} \]
			\item The probability distribution of a variable $X$ maps assignments of the variable to the respective probabilities:
				\[ \P( X = x ) = \P( \{ \omega : \omega \text{ consistent with } x \} ) \]
			\item We denote the probability distribution of $X$ as $\P( X )$ and the probability of an arbitrary event $\{ X = x \}$ as $\P( x )$
			\item It follows from the properties of probability function that
				\[ \sum_X \P( X ) = \sum_{x \in \Omega_X} \P( X = x ) = 1 \]
