\subsection{Joint Probability Distribution}
	\begin{frame}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A joint assignment to a set of variables is an event
				\[ {Gender} = M \text{ and } {City\ size} = b \leftrightarrow \alpha = \{ ( M , b ) \} \]
			\item The joint probability distribution of a set of variables is a function that maps joint assignments to their event probabilities:
				\[ \P( X = x , Y = y ) = \P( \{ \omega : \omega \text{ consistent with } x, y  \} ) \]
			\item We denote the probability distribution of $X$ and $Y$ as $\P( X )$ and the probability of an arbitrary joint event as $\P( x , y )$
			\item It follows from the properties of probability function that
				\[ \sum_{X,Y} \P( X , Y ) = \sum_{x \in \Omega_X} \sum_{x \in \Omega_Y}\P( X = x , Y = y ) = 1 \]
