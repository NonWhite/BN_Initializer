\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Learning Bayesian networks from data is a notably difficult problem, and practitioners often resort to approximate solutions such as greedy search. The quality of the solutions produced by greedy approaches strongly depends on the initial solution. In this work, we proposed new heuristics for producing good initial solutions to be fed into order-based greedy Bayesian network structure search methods.\\
Experiments with benchmark data sets suggested that our heuristics lead to better solutions while the size of the datasets increases, and that in most cases it leads to faster convergence with a small overhead (compared to the commonly used methods of generating initial solutions). The advantage of our heuristics grows with the size of the data set.\\
Our proposed techniques could be adapted to generate initial solutions for Structure- and Equivalence-based methods by generating DAGs as follows: the DFS approach could be adapted to saving the DFS directed tree and the FAS approach to returning the DAG obtained from removing the FAS instead of returning its topological order. Our heuristics can also be exploited by branch-and-bound solvers such as~\cite{Cassio11} finding optimal solutions. These ideas are left for future work.
