\section{Conclusions and Future Works}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We conclude that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Although all the approaches converge to the same score in most cases, the new methods could converge to a better solution using a similar number of iterations (in average)
	\item Weighted approach take less iterations than the unweighted one in most cases and also the percentage of solutions generated that converge to the best score is better in the first one
	\item New methods have greater percentage of solutions that converge than the random one
	\item The new methods explained in this article could be used in other types of Greedy Search doing some modifications
	\item The scoring function could be changed to another one in order to compare robustness between them and BIC score
	\item Experiments could be done with bigger datasets (more than 50 fields) in order to compare the efficiency of the methods
\end{itemize}
