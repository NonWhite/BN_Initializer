\section{Conclusions and Future Works}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We conclude that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Although all the approaches converge to the same score in most cases, the new methods could converge to a better solution
	\item The new methods converge in less or equal number of iterations, in average
	\item DFS-based approach improve the percentage number of solutions that converge to the maximum compared to the random approach, but the difference is not significantly
	\item FAS-based approach take less iterations than the other ones and take significantly less iterations to converge, in average
	\item FAS-based approach generate very good initial solutions with great percentage compared to the others
	\item The new methods explained in this article could be used in other types of Greedy Search doing some modifications
	\item The scoring function could be changed to another one in order to compare robustness between them and BIC score
	\item Experiments could be done with bigger datasets (more than 60 fields) in order to compare the efficiency of the methods
\end{itemize}
