\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Learning Bayesian networks from data is a notably difficult problem, and practitioners often resort to approximate solutions such as greedy search. The quality of the solutions produced by greedy approaches strongly depends on the initial solution. In this work, we proposed new heuristics for producing good initial solutions to be fed into greedy Bayesian network structure search methods.\\
Experiments with benchmark data sets showed that our heuristics lead to better solutions while the size of the datasets increases, and that in most cases it leads to faster convergence with a small overhead (compared to the commonly used methods of generating initial solutions). The advantage of our heuristics grows with the size of the data set.\\
Also these methods could be adapted to be used for Structure-based and Equivalence-based methods because they does not affect the search method, but only the initial solution generated. The DFS heuristic change from saving a list to saving the DFS directed tree built and the FAS heuristic return the DAG obtained from removing the FAS instead of returning its topological order. Our heuristics can also be exploited by branch-and-bound solvers that find optimal solutions. These are left for future work.
