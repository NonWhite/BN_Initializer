\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We conclude that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Generating an informed initial solution gives best networks that taking a random one
	\item To generate the informed initial solution takes more CPU time that the one in the first approach
	\item A higher number of attributes implies more CPU time for the second approach with a significant difference compared to the first approach
	\item With an informed solution, Local Search algorithm needs less CPU time for finding a better network
\end{itemize}
