It would also be interesting to compare the quality of the networks produced by each version of your strategy with the one produced by other strategies found in the literature such as:
- genetic programming: Pedro Larrafiaga, Mike Poza, Yosu Yurramendi, Roberto H. Murga, and Cindy M.H. Kuijpers Structure Learning of Bayesian Networks by Genetic Algorithms: Performance Analysis of Control Parameters.
- IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 18, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 1996

----------- REVIEW -----------
- It would be nice to see the running time of each approach, together and without the structure  learning algorithm used (which is also not mentioned in the paper).
